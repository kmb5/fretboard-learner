### How it works
Fretboard Learner is a very simple command line app which can help you remember where the notes are on the fretboard.
It tells you a randomly selected note that you need to play on your guitar and then listens to your microphone input to tell which note you are playing.
It doesn't pick a new note until you find the correct note.

### Installation & running
- Install required packages from requirements.txt
- Go to your terminal and run main.py `python main.py`
- Input the string you want to play on (E, A, D, G, B or e)
- Play the notes written in the terminal window
- If you play the correct note, it will move along to a next, randomly selected note
- If you want to quit any time, press cmd+c
